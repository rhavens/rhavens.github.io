			<p class="ttl">Hi, my name is Ryan Havens. All my life, Iâ€™ve known I wanted to become a programmer.</p>
			<p class="ttl">One day, as I lay in my cradle debugging some C++ classes, it all made perfect sense to me. Programming is my calling, technology my passion, development my labor.</p>
			<p class="ttl">Current Projects</p>
			<p class="ttl2"><a href="#">This Website</a></p>
			<p class="blt">Redesigning this website to reflect my design skills towards a professional audience.</p>
			<p class="ttl2"><a href="http://subleasy-site.herokuapp.com">Subleasy</a> (inaccessible, currently in beta testing)</p>
			<p class="blt">For a class project I collaborated with a team of Tufts students to develop a business model and financial plan for our grand idea, a student-to-student subletting service. On my own I brought the project to fruition, and Subleasy site (once launched) will provide a much-needed convenience to Tufts students seeking off-campus housing for a few months at a time.</p>
			<p class="ttl2"><a href="http://zbtomicron.github.io/">ZBT Omicron Homepage</a></p>
			<p class="blt">Managing the homepage for my fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau. Our website is the most easily accessible resource for potential recruits and others looking to learn more about us and what we contribute to the community.</p>
			<p class="ttl">Past Projects</p>
			<p class="ttl2"><a href="http://piper.link">Piper: A Social Media Experiment</a></p>
			<p class="blt">Designing and implementing a social media website with emphasis on scalability, optimization, and security as part of a web engineering team. Piper allows users to post images to a central feed and talk to other users in a live chatfeed. We emphasized single-page design with this project.</p>
			<p class="ttl2"><a href="https://github.com/rhavens/GroovebackupPlus">GroovebackupPlus</a></p>
			<p class="blt">A project that unfortunately had to be iced due to Grooveshark's abrupt shutdown. A tool that helps users navigate past common issues with Grooveshark. Using the website Groovebackup as a data source, GroovebackupPlus describes which songs have been removed due to takedown notices and which songs you have recently added.</p>
			<p class="ttl2"><a href="http://bodybuddy.herokuapp.com">BodyBuddy</a></p>
			<p class="blt">A fitness-tracking program that aggregates a user's health and workout preferences in order to design a customized fitness routine for the user. Currently not available for testing.</p>
			<p class="ttl2"><a href="http://coursecomparator.herokuapp.com">Tufts Course Online Comparator</a></p>
			<p class="blt">A webservice for Tufts students allowing them to compare the difficulty of their courseload and submit their own opinions on classes. Built at Tufts Polyhack Fall 2014.</p>
			<p class="ttl2">Various University Assignments</p>
			<p class="blt">I have completed coursework in multiple programming languages and disciplines during my two years at Tufts. In order to maintain academic integrity, these projects are not listed on my public github repository.</p>
			<p class="ttl2">If you have further inquiries, please contact me.</p>
