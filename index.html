					<p class="title">Hi, my name is Ryan Havens. All my life, Iâ€™ve known I wanted to become a programmer.</p>
					<p class="title">One day, as I lay in my cradle debugging some C++ classes, it all made perfect sense to me. Programming is my calling, technology my passion, development my labor.</p>

						<p class="title">Current Projects</p>
						<div class="project">
							<p class="subtitle"><a href="#">This Website</a></p>
							<p class="blt">Redesigning this website to reflect my design skills towards a professional audience.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="project">
							<p class='subtitle'><a href='https://facethemusic.herokuapp.com/'>face.the.music</a></p>
							<p class='blt'>face.the.music is a fun lititlee webapp that recognizes facial expressions and plays music according to your detected emotional state. The project came about as some hacky combination of working with the Spotify API (which I wanted to do) and working with facial recognition libraries (co-founder Gain Hagenau's idea). Somehow it caught on - people seem to find this kind of thing at least mildly amusing, and the music it plays seems to pair quite well (according to user feedback).</p>
						<div class="project">
							<p class="subtitle"><a href="http://subleasy-site.herokuapp.com/">Subleasy</a></p>
							<p class="blt">For a class project I collaborated with a team of Tufts students to develop a business model and financial plan for our grand idea, a student-to-student subletting service. On my own I brought the project to fruition, and Subleasy provides a much-needed convenience to Tufts students seeking off-campus housing for a few months at a time.</p>
