			<p class="ttl">Hi, my name is Ryan Havens. All my life, I’ve known I wanted to become a programmer.</p>
			<p class="ttl">One day, as I lay in my cradle debugging some C++ classes, it all made perfect sense to me. Programming is my calling, technology my passion, development my labor.</p>
			<p class="blt">In reality I made my way through my first C++ classes at 14, and today I can write programs in ten different programming languages, with mastery in C++, Java, Ruby, and Python. I have put much effort into developing web applications during my college years - it’s easy to create a helpful, working application in a short period of time, and the rapid pace of development helps keep my creative juices flowing.</p>
			<p class="blt">At Tufts University, I’ve worked alone, worked with other developers, and even worked with the computer-illiterate. In Spring 2015 I built a student-to-student home rental website, which I continue to improve to this day. </p>
				<p class="blt">I am proud of creating something that matters to my student body, and potentially students across the country. For my previous internship I developed UI tools for Ab Initio, writing and refactoring more than 5,000 lines of code over the summer.</p>
<p class="blt">I bring to the table experience, passion, and self-motivation. I have led and managed my own projects, brought simple concepts to fruition, and I hope I can do the same for you.</p>
